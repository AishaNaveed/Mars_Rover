Work on the Kata that moves a rover around on a grid:-

* Rover will recieve 2 input strings.
* You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover along with the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
* The rover receives a character array of commands.

[Flow chart to represent the outline of the starting of the program](./flowchart.pdf)

* Implemented commands that move the rover forward.
* Implemented commands that turn the rover left/right.
* Implemented obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point.
